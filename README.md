# ðŸ”¢ Handwritten Digits Recognition ðŸ§   

## Overview  
This project implements a **handwritten digit recognition system** using a **neural network** trained on the **MNIST dataset**. The model predicts digits (0-9) from handwritten images.  
This project was part of my course (Machine Learning by Andrew Ng from Stanford University and DeepLearningAI)

## Features  
âœ… Built using a **fully connected neural network (FCNN)**  
âœ… Trained on the **MNIST dataset**  
âœ… Uses **TensorFlow/Keras** for model building  
âœ… Supports visualization of digit samples and training progress  

## Dataset  
- **MNIST dataset**: Contains **60,000 training images** and **10,000 test images** of handwritten digits.  
- Each image is **28x28 pixels**, grayscale.  

## Technologies Used  
- **Python** (NumPy, Pandas)  
- **TensorFlow & Keras** (for model training)  
- **Matplotlib** (for visualization)  

## How to Use  
### Running the Model  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nuriddinovN/handwritten-digits-recognition.git
   cd handwritten-digits-recognition
